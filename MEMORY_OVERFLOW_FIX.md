# 🧠 Memory Overflow Fix - URGENT

## ❌ Critical Issue

Your Render service is crashing with:
```
Instance failed: Ran out of memory (used over 512MB)
```

This happens because the previous session file reading was loading too much data into memory.

## ✅ Emergency Fixes Applied

### 1. **Reduced Memory Limits**
```bash
# Before: 256MB
NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=200 --gc-interval=100 --expose-gc"
```

### 2. **Optimized Session File Reading**
- ✅ Only read essential session files (5 files instead of all files)
- ✅ Skip files larger than 1MB to prevent memory bloat
- ✅ Added file size checks before reading

### 3. **Aggressive Memory Management**
- ✅ Force garbage collection every 100ms
- ✅ Automatic memory monitoring every 30 seconds
- ✅ Auto-cleanup when memory exceeds 150MB
- ✅ Auto-restart WhatsApp client if memory exceeds 180MB

### 4. **Ultra-Lightweight Puppeteer**
- ✅ Reduced Chrome memory limit to 150MB
- ✅ Disabled more background features
- ✅ Added memory pressure optimization flags

## 🚀 Updated Environment Variables

**Update these in your Render dashboard:**
```
NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=200 --gc-interval=100 --expose-gc
```

**Remove if exists:**
```
❌ Remove: NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=256
```

## 📊 Memory Monitoring

The app now shows detailed memory usage:
```
💾 Server Memory: 45MB        ✅ Normal
⚠️ High memory usage detected! ⚠️ Warning at 150MB  
🧹 Memory after cleanup: 35MB  ✅ Cleanup working
🚨 Critical memory usage!      🚨 Emergency at 180MB
```

## 🔧 What to Do Immediately

### Step 1: Deploy This Fix
1. **Push the code:**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Update Render environment variables:**
   - Go to Render dashboard → Environment
   - Update `NODE_OPTIONS` to: `--max-old-space-size=200 --gc-interval=100 --expose-gc`

3. **Trigger deployment**

### Step 2: Monitor Memory Usage
1. **Watch the logs** for memory reports every 30 seconds
2. **Should see memory stay under 100MB** during normal operation
3. **Automatic cleanup** should prevent crashes

### Step 3: Verify It's Working
```bash
# Test the health endpoint
curl https://tailoring-whatsapp-bot.onrender.com/healthz

# Should return 200 OK without memory crashes
```

## 🎯 Expected Results

- ✅ **Memory usage: 40-80MB** (instead of 500MB+)
- ✅ **No more crashes** from memory overflow
- ✅ **Automatic cleanup** when memory gets high
- ✅ **Session persistence** still works with smaller footprint
- ✅ **Stable WhatsApp connection** without memory pressure

## 🆘 If Still Crashing

1. **Reduce memory limit further:**
   ```
   NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=150 --gc-interval=50 --expose-gc
   ```

2. **Disable external session storage temporarily:**
   ```
   # Remove these environment variables:
   SESSION_STORAGE_TYPE=jsonbin
   JSONBIN_API_KEY=your_key
   JSONBIN_BIN_ID=your_bin_id
   ```

3. **Use file storage only** (will require QR scan after restarts but won't crash)

## 📈 Performance Optimizations

- **30-second memory checks** instead of 60-second
- **Proactive garbage collection** before hitting limits
- **Smart file reading** with size limits
- **Chrome memory constraints** to prevent browser bloat

This should completely eliminate the memory crashes! 🎯
